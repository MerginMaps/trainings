## Mergin Maps Introduction

A field data collection tool built on the free and open-source QGIS which allows you to 

* collect data in the field
* store it effectively in the cloud
* synchronise your data with your team
* share with various levels of access
* position tracking while in the field
* offline field data capture when a connection is unavailable

## Perks of the Mergin Maps sync system:

- No need for cables to get your data on/off your device
- Share projects with others for collaborative working, even offline
- Updates from different surveyors are intelligently merged
- Push data back from the field in real time
- Version history and cloud-based backup
- Fine-grained access control
- Record metadata such as EXIF, GPS and external GNSS device information
- Sync with your PostGIS datasets and external media storage such as S3 and MinIO

* Live demo
* Step-by-step tutorial

## Best Practice Tips

* Making changes in the data schema of layers can lead to issues in the synchronisation process. Design the data schema carefully when creating a layer to avoid the need to change it later.
* **Always use GeoPackage for survey layers**, otherwise, it is not possible to detect changes from other users and they may be overwritten. Overwritten files are stored in a conflict file.
* **Add some extra back-up field attributes** when creating a survey layer and hide them in the form design. These can serve as a backup when you need more fields.
* If you do not need a field, **remove it from the form**. You don't need to delete it from the table.
* **Instead of renaming a field, change its alias**.
* **Add new layers to your project as separate GeoPackages**.
* use **GeoTIFF** format for your raster files or store them in a separate GeoPackage database
