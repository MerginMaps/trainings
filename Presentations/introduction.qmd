## Best Practice Tips

* Making changes in the data schema of layers can lead to issues in the synchronisation process. Design the data schema carefully when creating a layer to avoid the need to change it later.
* **Always use GeoPackage for survey layers**, otherwise, it is not possible to detect changes from other users and they may be overwritten. Overwritten files are stored in a conflict file.
* **Add some extra back-up field attributes** when creating a survey layer and hide them in the form design. These can serve as a backup when you need more fields.
* If you do not need a field, **remove it from the form**. You don't need to delete it from the table.
* **Instead of renaming a field, change its alias**.
* **Add new layers to your project as separate GeoPackages**.
* use **GeoTIFF** format for your raster files or store them in a separate GeoPackage database
